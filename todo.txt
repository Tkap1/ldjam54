we still have that ui bug where the first upgrade is not always the default. cringe!!
buffs like: every second, fire a block breaking laser or whatever

polish:
	some block dead animation instead of just disappearing
	upgrade/level sound
	cool cursor
	sound when moving through upgrade options
	make it so the particles when breaking block appear on the cursor if the block is hovered. random otherwise
	camera smoothing?
	portal sound effect
	some indicator of whether we can dash or not
		or some visual effect when dash cooldown is refreshed
	dash visuals/sound


probably not:
	after reaching the bottom, you have to go up???? it makes +1 jump upgrades useful!!

we stop for 1 frame when breaking a block while dashing. to fix this we need a list of all colliding tiles, not just 1. then we stop movement
	if any of the colliding tiles is an unbreakable block, otherwise we keep going.
	the bug is that when colliding with 2 tiles, one of them being unbreakable and the other breakable, if we only get the breakable collision,
	then we will not reset the movement, which will put us inside the breakable block
