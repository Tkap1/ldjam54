slow down wall upgrade?
need a satisfying sound when breaking blocks!!
unbreakable block
gemstones (just a big exp, easy to break block)
portals that teleport you down?? (and then up when going in reverse)
dash upgrade? breaks blocks (only sideways?)
make weight_add a float so we can increase frequency by height buy very slowly
buffs like: every second, fire a block breaking laser or whatever
best time
exp bar
hot ui system
see time ingame
fix background

1 frame particle could server as light??

polish:
	particles
	sounds
	more gemstones
	find closest tile to mouse and mine that
	exp bar flash after getting exp
	background
	some block dead animation instead of just disappearing
	upgrade/level sound


probably not:
	after reaching the bottom, you have to go up???? it makes +1 jump upgrades useful!!
