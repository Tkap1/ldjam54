slow down wall upgrade?
portals that teleport you down?? (and then up when going in reverse)
dash upgrade? breaks blocks (only sideways?)
make weight_add a float so we can increase frequency by height buy very slowly
buffs like: every second, fire a block breaking laser or whatever
best time
exp bar
hot ui system
see time ingame
fix background

1 frame particle could server as light??

polish:
	particles
	sounds
	more gemstones
	find closest tile to mouse and mine that
	exp bar flash after getting exp
	background
	some block dead animation instead of just disappearing
	upgrade/level sound
	cool cursor
	sound when moving through upgrade options
	make it so the particles when breaking block appear on the cursor if the block is hovered. random otherwise
	camera smoothing?
	portal sound effect


probably not:
	after reaching the bottom, you have to go up???? it makes +1 jump upgrades useful!!
