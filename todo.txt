dash upgrade? breaks blocks (only sideways?)
buffs like: every second, fire a block breaking laser or whatever

polish:
	particles
	sounds
	more gemstones
	find closest tile to mouse and mine that
	exp bar flash after getting exp
	background
	some block dead animation instead of just disappearing
	upgrade/level sound
	cool cursor
	sound when moving through upgrade options
	make it so the particles when breaking block appear on the cursor if the block is hovered. random otherwise
	camera smoothing?
	portal sound effect


probably not:
	after reaching the bottom, you have to go up???? it makes +1 jump upgrades useful!!
